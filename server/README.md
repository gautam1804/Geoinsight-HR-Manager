This app is designed to provide a seamless experience for visualizing and interacting with employee data based on their locations. Whether you're a manager overseeing a large team or an HR professional interested in understanding ymy workforce's spatial distribution, my app has you covered.

Key Features

Employee Data Management: my app allows you to create and manage employee profiles with essential information such as Name, Department, Address, and Geo-coordinates. Editing an employee's address will automatically update their geo-coordinates, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

Interactive Mapping: The heart of my app lies in its interactive mapping interface powered by Leaflet. It enables you to visualize clusters of employee locations on a map. As the number of employees increases in a particular location, the clusters dynamically adjust to give you an overview of the workforce concentration.

Cluster Hierarchies: When you click on a cluster, the app intelligently breaks down the larger cluster into smaller ones, further refining the visualization. This hierarchical approach allows you to understand not only where ymy employees are but also the distribution patterns within specific areas.

Detailed Employee Insights: As you zoom in to the final level of clustering, the app provides an in-depth view. Clicking on an individual employee pin reveals a popup with essential information, including the employee's ID and basic details.

Use Cases
